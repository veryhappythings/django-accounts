django-accounts

This is the bare minimum stuff you need to get django.contrib.auth up and running. It seems like quite a lot to me, so maybe I'm missing the point. If I am, please let me know!

Here's what it contains:

accounts
 - 3 templates, in templates/registration (login, logged_out, profile)
 - urls.py file containing the urls logging in, out, and getting profiles
 - a view to get profiles (ok, technically you don't need this)
